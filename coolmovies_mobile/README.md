## Original challenge description:

.

```

You have to add the cool movies review feature to the existing `coolmovies-mobile`.

This folder contains a basic Flutter application with some example callbacks.

We've setup GraphQL for you. We recommend that you work on an emulator only, there's no need to test your application in a real device.

## Acceptance Criteria

**You will be evaluated on your UI/UX as we believe this is an important skill to have. Please put time and effort into this.**

**DO NOT USE EXISTING TEMPLATES. You can copy the design but not the code, we have to evaluate you by your coding skills.**

For your solution to be accepted it is required that your application is able to:

1. List all the available movies, showing at least the title ✅
2. Tapping on a movie must open a view page presenting all the available information to the user ✅
3. Each movie page must display all its reviews ✅
4. Each review should consist of (at least): title, body and stars (1-5) ✅
5. The user should be able to create new reviews ✅
6. The user should be able to edit their own reviews ✅

Anything else is up to you (animations, assets, 3rd party dependencies, etc). We will consider all your additions so don't stick to the minimum!

Good luck!
